      <h1>Glynsight</h1>
      <p>Glynsight helps you visualize and interactively compare your glycan expression profiles.
        The tool was initially developed with a focus on IgG N-glycan profiles but it was extended to usage with any experiment, which produces N- or O-linked glycan expression data.
